# Heart-Disease-Classification
End-to-End Machine Learning project for Heart Disease prediction using Python and Scikit-Learn.

# 🫀 End-to-End Heart Disease Classification

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using patient medical data. It demonstrates a full end-to-end machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing, exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load and clean dataset  
2. Perform EDA (visualizations, correlations)  
3. Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM)  
4. Compare performance metrics  
5. Select best model and save it  

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Dataset
File: `heart.csv`  
Target: `target` (1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease)

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Amol2772/Heart-Disease-Classification.git

cd Heart-Disease-Classification

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
